<p>Having both academic and professional experience in software engineering in the banking industry has provided me with a solid foundation in building and maintaining data infrastructure required for businesses to make data-informed decisions. Additionally, my hands-on experience in various tools and algorithms during my masters degree also further enhanced my ability in deriving meaningful and actionable business insights from data.
